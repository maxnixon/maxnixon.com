									<div class="text">My name's <strong>Maxwell Nixon</strong>, web development hasn't always been my pasion, infact my real passion is creating solutions to the point where there's a finished End Result. That's always been my fix I WANT IT DONE! Whether it was when I was fasinated with being an ironworker... "I still was just FIXED on finishing the gap in struture, not connecting that individual beam"... or with Carpentry - framing homes... "I just wanted that damn home's issues solved and built, I could care less about the floor I finished that day/ or week!" So who am I fooling- the art of web development you could say always had the structure or focus that my mind craves. And the fact I get to see a totally fasinating website, and not even having to bust a single sweat anymore... "Yeah that definetly adds some sprinkles onto the finished work;)
